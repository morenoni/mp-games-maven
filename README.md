# Abstract games

A mini-project for Grinnell's CSC-207.

Authors:

* Tiffany tang
* Nicky Moreno
* Samuel A. Rebelsky (Starter code)

Instructions:

* Command-line arguments:

                * -r rows - set up the number of rows of the board
                * -c cols  - set up the number of columns of the board
                * -p1 player1 - set up the name of the player one
                * -p2 player2 - set up the name of the player two
  
  The only move a player can make is to specify which column of the board
                that you want to insert your token. It will automatically insert a token
                for you at the position at the last empty row at the specified column.
                

                * INSERT1: insert a token for player one
                * INSERT2: insert a token for player two
  
  Your goal is to make four tokens in a row, whether diagonal or horizontal,
                before the other player. Otherise, you lose.
